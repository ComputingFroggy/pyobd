<h1>Installation Instructions</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>This has been tested and packaged on <em>Ubuntu 18.04</em>. It should work in other environment too.</p>
First, install these and make sure they work.

<h3>Python</h3>

A recent release is needed. Developement took place using the 2.3.x
release series. Any 2.X release <i>should</i> work, but hasn't been
tested. Under MacOSX 10.3 (panther), Python is installed by
default. Installation instructions are available at the python
website: <a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a>

<h3>PySerial</h3>

This is needed to communicate with the serial port. It is available
from sourceforge: <a
		     href="http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/">http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/</a>. Download
and install it. Use version 2.0.
<p>On <em>Ubuntu</em>, install package <tt>python-serial</tt>.</p>

<h3>WxPython</h3>

WxPython is needed if you want to use the pretty graphical interface
to sensor data and DTC management. It's available at <a
							href="http://www.wxpython.org">www.wxpython.org</a>.
<p>On <i>Ubuntu</i>, install package <tt>python-wxgtk3.0</tt>.</p>


<h2>Installation</h2>

After those requirements, installation is a snap. Simply download the
release tarball and uncompress it. To "install" pyOBD on the system, simply copy
the release directory to wherever you want (i.e. /opt, /usr/local).

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Running it</h3>
Just run the file <strong>pyobd</strong>.<br/>
On <em>Windows</em>, you might need to run the command <tt>python pyobd</tt>.<br />
On <em>MacOS</em>, you might need to run the command  <tt>pythonw pyobd</tt>.

<h3>Configuring</h3>
On the first run, you will need to specifiy where is located your device connecting to the OBD-II plug. 
Nowadays, serial port are not often used, so it is likely you will be using an USB port.
